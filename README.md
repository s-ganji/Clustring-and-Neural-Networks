# Clustring-and-Neural-Networks
Implementation of Perceptron, Kmeans and Dbscan algorithms on different data sets, Data Mining course assignment, Fall 2019
## Question 1
Implement Perceptron algorithm, then design a neural network with 1 hidden layer and compare its function on data separation and its accuracy with perceptron.
## Question 2
1. First, cluster the given datasets using the kmeans and dbscan algorithms. Find the appropriate number of clusters for kmeans by the elbow method. Also for the dbscan method, set the parameters so that in addition to clustering, the outgoing data is also detected and the result is drawn.
2. Draw a dendrogram to find the right number of clusters for each dataset and use agglomerative or divisive clustering using one of the hierarchical methods. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the hierarchical method. Using the scikit learn library will help you a lot.
## Question 3
1. Categorize MNIST data using neural networks. <br/>
First, categorize this data with keras or tensor using the fully connected network. Try to find the number of layers and neurons needed in each layer to get the highest accuracy in the test data.
2. In this section, do the same classification using a convolutional Neural Network. Compare the accuracy obtained in the first and second methods.
